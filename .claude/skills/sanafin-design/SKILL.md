# Sanafin design skill

The page sells trust to pre-seed investors first and to Swiss digital-health buyers second. It must look like a
company that already exists, not like a generated landing page. Read this before editing `app/` or `components/`,
and run the review at the end against real screenshots, never against the code alone.

## 1. Brand system (tokens live in `app/globals.css`)

| Role | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Paper | `#fbfaf8` / `#f8f4ef` | page background |
| Plate | `#f5f1ed` | at most one plate group per screen |
| Ink | `#1f1a17` | headings, body emphasis |
| Ink soft | `rgba(31,26,23,.45)` | second line of a two-tone heading only |
| Muted | `#766d67` (min) / `#6f6660` | body, captions; never lighter than `#766d67` on paper |
| Orange | `#f15d22` (hover `#d94f18`) | the primary button and at most one other accent per screen |
| Teal | `#14b8a6` fill, `#0f766e` text | "verified / pass" states and the film legend only |
| Type | Geist variable (`--font-sans`), display weight 400, `-0.035em` | one family; Playfair italic is allowed as an accent voice in at most two places on the page |
| Radius | 24 px containers, 16–18 px inner cards, 9999 buttons | |
| Motion | fade-up 0.7 s `[0.16,1,0.3,1]`, once, section-level only | never on every child |

Two CTA labels exist: **Book a discovery call** (orange) and **Request the deck** (ink). Never a third.

## 2. Section grammar (the anti-template rules)

A page reads as designed when consecutive sections use different sentence structures. Available structures:

- **Editorial** – heading + one paragraph at ≤ 60ch, no container, generous top and bottom space.
- **Stat row** – 3 large numerals with one-line captions and footnotes; no cards around them if the row above or below already uses cards.
- **Split** – text column + one visual (film, screenshot, still); the visual is the hero of the section.
- **List** – rows separated by hairlines (`border-[#ece7e2]`), no cards; used for timelines, publications, partners, FAQ.
- **Bento** – tiles on plates; reserved for the product, once.
- **Band** – one full-width image or plate with a short message; used for the closing, once.

Rules:
1. No two consecutive sections may share the same structure. Two card grids in a row is the most common failure.
2. One eyebrow style, in muted grey, and only where the section title does not already say what the section is. Orange is not a label colour.
3. Two-tone headings (ink + soft ink) in at most four sections; the others get a single-colour heading, sometimes shorter than one line.
4. Label budget: at most one "illustrative / example data" note per section, placed once, in a caption; never as chips.
5. Pacing: alternate long and short sections. At least two sections on the page should fit in under 60 % of a 900 px viewport.
6. Right-column paragraphs are capped at `max-w-md` (≈ 60ch). Headings wrap to at most three lines at 1280 px.
7. Whitespace does the grouping before borders do; borders before backgrounds; backgrounds before shadows.
8. Icons are used only when they carry meaning a word cannot (sources, LinkedIn). Decorative lucide icons are removed.
9. **Fintech-in-healthcare texture.** Every screen carries one technical artefact that could only come from this product: a ledger with tabular mono figures, the verification certificate, the terminal output of a verification run, an API response, a clinical value with its threshold. Calm layout is not the same as a brochure; without these the page stops feeling like software.
10. **A face early.** A real person appears within the first three screens (founder note, portrait beside a quote from the deck). Team cards alone, seven screens down, do not give the company a face.
11. One dark technical panel per page is allowed and encouraged (the terminal); it is the product's voice, not a decoration.

## 3. Honesty rules (enforced by `scripts/check-copy.mjs`)

- Every figure carries `<Fn id>` into `lib/sources.ts` or is labelled "Sanafin estimate" / "illustrative".
- Never: escrow, blockchain/EVM/L2, round size, TAM/SAM, guarantee, real-time, HIPAA, SOC 2, "Backed by".
- No fake logos, testimonials, people or UI presented as customer data. Generated stills are metaphors and are captioned as such; the product preview says "example data" inside the frame.
- Partners under NDA stay anonymised (`named: false` in `lib/traction.ts`).

## 4. Imagery

- World: cream linen, pale oak, brushed brass, one teal and one amber marble, soft north light. Slots live in `lib/media.ts`; every component renders a plain plate when a slot is `null`.
- Prefer one real artefact per screen over a generated one when it exists: a product screenshot, the film, a portrait.
- Never people, coins, pills, flags, or UI in generated images.
- Minimal, one motif: a thin brass threshold line and the two marbles, on mostly empty linen. Never balance scales, gavels, books, envelopes-as-legal-mail or any prop that reads as a law firm, bank or notary. Sanafin is a fintech in healthcare; the objects should say measurement and threshold, not justice or tradition.
- A generated still is a backdrop, never the subject: small objects, large negative space, and the product frame or the text carries the screen.

## 5. Review procedure (do this before every commit that touches the page)

1. Build, start, capture `/` at 1440×900, 1280×800 and 390×844 (`scratchpad/shots9.mjs` pattern) and read the images.
2. Walk the sections top to bottom and write down each one's structure from §2. Fix any repeat.
3. Count orange elements per viewport; more than two means labels are doing layout's job.
4. Check the first screen: headline, CTAs and proof line above the fold at 1280×800, product frame at least 60 % visible.
5. Check three Mobbin references for the section you changed (`mcp__Mobbin__search_sections`) and name what they do that the section does not.
6. Run `node scripts/check-copy.mjs`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`.

A change that improves a section but makes it look like its neighbours is not an improvement.
