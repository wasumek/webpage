      {
        q: "What does Sanafin cost?",
        a: "A platform licence, a per-patient fee on enrolment into an outcome-linked pathway, and a success fee on funds recovered when a cohort misses its threshold. The first pilot is a fixed price agreed on the call.",
      },
      {
        q: "How is this different from an HTA consultant or a CRO?",
        a: "A consultancy appraises evidence by hand, per project; a CRO runs the study but brings no money. Sanafin makes the funding conditional and the verification repeatable: the outcome definition, the threshold and the settlement rule are written once, and the verdict can be re-run by anyone from the exported file.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens when data is missing or a patient drops out?",
        a: "Dropout and data-freshness rules are part of the contract. Monitoring surfaces gaps early, and unmet or unverifiable milestones are held or returned to the funder rather than paid on trust.",
      },
      {
        q: "How fast can a pilot start?",
        a: "Our target is a scoped pilot within two weeks of the first call: data connected in week one, rules live with a first verification report in week two. Going live depends on data access and the funder's sign-off.",
      },

    label: "Insurers, employers, hospitals",
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "Who holds the money?",
        a: "A licensed custody partner. The funder commits funds up front; they are held by the custodian and only leave when Sanafin issues a settlement instruction on a verified pass. Sanafin never holds funds and is not a bank or payment institution.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is Sanafin a medical device?",
        a: "Sanafin does not diagnose or treat. It checks agreed endpoints against contract rules for payment purposes. The classification of each programme under the medical devices ordinance is assessed with regulatory counsel before production use.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do you prevent gaming or selection bias?",
        a: "The threshold, cohort definition and data sources are fixed before enrolment, every value is hashed on entry, and the verdict is re-computable offline. Changing one value after the fact changes the fingerprint, which either side can detect without trusting Sanafin.",
      },
      {
        q: "Where is data hosted and who can see it?",
        a: "Hosting region is agreed per contract, in Switzerland or the EU. Data is pseudonymised for verification, access is role-based, and both parties receive the same audit record.",
      },
    ],

  {
    id: "investors",
    label: "Investors",
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "How big is this beyond Swiss digital therapeutics?",
        a: "Switzerland is the proving ground, not the market: its reimbursement bar is among the strictest in Europe, and clearing it is the credential. The same layer settles the German app prices that are performance-linked by law since January 2026, the Swiss medicine rebates opened for consultation under Art. 52b E-KVG, the CMS chronic-care thresholds in the United States, and gene and cell therapies, where paying first and reconciling later runs for eleven years. One contract shape, three jurisdictions, four asset classes.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why not Lyfegen, EY or a rebate platform?",
        a: "Each covers one third of the workflow: evidence, contract logic or settlement. Rebate platforms move money only as a claw-back inside an existing commercial relationship, which a pre-listing manufacturer does not have. Sanafin combines verification, contract logic and settlement in one reusable layer, with proofs anyone can re-run.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the traction today?",
        a: "Four signed letters of intent with Swiss care partners, a clinical proof of concept running with a Swiss hospital to October 2026, eight publications behind the model, and non-dilutive support from Innosuisse-funded programmes. No funder has committed money and no fee has been tested yet. The next milestones are one funder with a named budget owner and the first CHF committed conditionally.",
